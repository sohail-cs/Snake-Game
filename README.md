# Snake-Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Tkinter.

## Introduction

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen eating food. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or into itself. This project implements the Snake game in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Adjustable game speed.
- Score tracking.
- Game over screen upon collision with borders or itself.
- Responsive arrow key controls.


## How to Play

- The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible to score points and avoid collisions.
- Use arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to change the snake's direction.
- The game ends if the snake hits the border or itself.

## Controls

- `Up Arrow` - Move snake upwards.
- `Down Arrow` - Move snake downwards.
